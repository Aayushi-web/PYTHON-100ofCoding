# Python Module
Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

# Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
 # External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.


# Escape Sequneces and single/multi Line comments:
 Escape Sequnece are that 2individual charcters  which is added asa single chaters \n =====> nextline..
                                                                                    \"  \" ==> for double quotation
                                                                                    \'  \' ===> for single line quotations
 
# Comments are those types of methods that are needed to add for further understanding and fellow developers
 #====> single line cooments
 '''  ''' =====> multiline comments
 """  """ ======> multilines comments
 
# datatype
1)list ==> can me modified
2)tuple  ==>list but cannot be modified
3)map ==> it has key and value pairs
# All things in python are OBJECTS
# Typecasting 
there are 2 types are--
1)inplicite- 
python itself change the variable type and solve the problem by own
2)Explicite---
Developer have to say that what types of typeCasting they want or suitable for their program
Methods are---
a:int(), b:oct(),c:str(),d:hex() etc.

# Strings
Strings is a type of array indexing of strings are starts with 0 and ends with (n-1)
# String slicing
sen="sjkdlkjd"
print(sen[0:4])===> 0 include and (n-1)are exclude
# String Negative Slicing
print(-1:-5)
{len(sen)-1: len(sen)-5} ==>python work

# LOOPS in string
string="happy Birthday"
for string in sen:
print(string)
 
 # length of string
 name="aayushi"
 len(name)
# output: "7"
