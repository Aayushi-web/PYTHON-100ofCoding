#python Module
Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.
